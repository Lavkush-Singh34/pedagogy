## 🧠 Thinking Like a Scientist

### Activity 1.1: **“Question the Answer”**

- Encourages students to frame _creative questions_ based on given answers.
    
- Teaches them the **importance of asking questions** in science.
    

Example given:

> Answer: "Just add some milk."  
> Possible Question: "How can I make my tea taste better?"

## 🧑‍🏫 **Pedagogical Plan** – _"The Ever-Evolving World of Science"_

### 🎯 **Learning Objectives**

By the end of the chapter, students should:

- Understand science as a process of questioning and discovery.
    
- Recognize the interconnection of various science fields (physics, chemistry, biology, etc.).
    
- Appreciate real-world applications of scientific thinking.
    
- Develop curiosity through creative questioning.

### 🪄 **How to Start the Class (Classroom Conversation Starter)**

**👋 Start with a curious question:**  
“Have you ever wondered why your school uniform gets a red stain when haldi falls on it—and why soap sometimes doesn’t help?”  
_Let them guess or respond freely._

Then say:

> “That’s science! But not the boring kind—the one where you ask questions and explore the answers with experiments! This year, we’re going to explore science like real thinkers and discoverers.”

**🧠 Continue with a short interactive activity:**  
Ask them:

- “What do you think science is?”
    
- “Can you name one thing in your home that works because of science?”
    

**🎬 Wrap the intro with this line:**

> “This chapter is not about learning definitions. It’s about learning how to think like a scientist—and how to see science in everyday life.”

## 🧪 **Teaching Flow (Lesson Breakdown)**

### 🧩 1. **Science is a Process**

- Use real-life examples: cooking, boiling water, switching on a light.
    
- Emphasize: _Science starts with curiosity._
    

> **Activity**: Ask students to bring a “science question” from home next class. E.g., “Why does metal feel colder than wood?”

---

### 🔗 2. **Interconnectedness of Science**

- Show how chemistry helps understand materials, biology explains growth, and physics explains motion and energy.
    
- Use visuals or mind maps.
    

---

### 🌊 3. **Real-Life Science Themes Previewed**

Introduce briefly:

- **Materials** (sourness, stains)
    
- **Electric circuits**
    
- **Reversible and irreversible changes**
    
- **Heat and water cycle**
    
- **Growth in animals and humans**
    
- **Light, shadows, time, eclipses**
    

> Don’t go in-depth. Just give a taste so students get curious for later chapters.
