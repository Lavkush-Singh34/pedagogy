- Flat metal disc = Negative terminal
    
- Portable source of electricity
    

---

### **5. Battery**

- Combination of two or more cells
    
- Correct arrangement: Positive of one connected to Negative of the next
    

---

### **6. Types of Lamps**

- **Incandescent Lamp**:
    
    - Contains **filament** that glows when current passes
        
- **LED (Light Emitting Diode)**:
    
    - No filament
        
    - Current flows in one direction only
        
    - Long wire = Positive terminal, Short wire = Negative terminal
        

---

### **7. Making a Lamp/LED Glow**

- Proper circuit required: both terminals of the lamp must be connected to the respective terminals of the cell
    
- LED glows only when connected correctly
    
- **Glowing = Complete Circuit**
    

---

### **8. Electrical Circuit**

- A **closed path** through which electric current flows
    
- Current flows from **positive to negative terminal**
    
- **Open circuit** = lamp does not glow
    
- **Closed circuit** = lamp glows
    

---

### **9. Electric Switch**

- Device that **opens or closes** the circuit
    
- Can be made using simple materials (safety pin, drawing pins, cardboard)
    
- Switch **OFF** = Circuit open
    
- Switch **ON** = Circuit closed
    

---

### **10. Circuit Diagrams**

- Use of **standard symbols** to represent:
    
    - Electric cell
        
    - Battery
        
    - Lamp
        
    - LED
        
    - Switch (ON/OFF)
        
    - Wires
        
- Helps simplify and standardize circuit representations
    

---

### **11. Conductors and Insulators**

- **Conductors**: Materials through which electricity can flow  
    _Examples: metals like copper, aluminum, iron_
    
- **Insulators**: Materials that block the flow of electricity  
    _Examples: plastic, rubber, wood, glass_
    
- Practical Activity: Using a **conduction tester** to test various objects
    

---

### **12. Safety Precautions with Electricity**

- Never use power supply from mains for experiments
    
- Do not handle electrical devices with wet hands
    
- Use only **batteries or cells** in experiments
    

---

### **13. AC vs DC Electricity (Concept Introduction)**

- **DC (Direct Current)** from batteries — used in small devices
    
- **AC (Alternating Current)** from wall sockets — used for larger appliances
    

---

### **14. In a Nutshell Summary Points** (Textbook Recap)

- Cell, battery, lamp, LED, switch, conductors, insulators
    
- Circuit completion
    
- Symbol usage
    
- Safety guidelines
    

---

### **15. Let Us Enhance Our Learning (Exercise Questions)**

- Conceptual MCQs
    
- Circuit-based reasoning (e.g., broken filament, wrong connections)
    
- Predict outcomes of different switch positions
    
- Identify errors in a faulty circuit
    
- Identify conductors/insulators from real objects

Here is a complete **pedagogical guide** on **how to start and teach** the chapter **"Electricity: Circuits and Their Components"** (Grade 7 Science):

---

## 🧠 **Pedagogy: Teaching Plan for “Electricity: Circuits and Their Components”**

---

### 🎯 **Teaching Objectives:**

By the end of the lesson(s), students should be able to:

- Identify components of an electric circuit (cell, battery, switch, lamp, wires, LED).
    
- Understand how electric current flows and what makes a lamp or LED glow.
    
- Differentiate between conductors and insulators.
    
- Read and draw basic circuit diagrams.
    
- Practice basic electrical safety while experimenting.

## ✨ **How to Start the Class (Engaging Introduction)**

---

### 🧑‍🏫 **Begin with a Story or Situation:**

🔊 **Teacher says:**

> “Last night, there was a power cut in our area. My brother needed a torch. I gave him one—but it didn’t work! Why do you think that happened? What makes a torch work? Can we find out together?”

🧩 Let students guess:

- What makes the torch glow?
    
- What’s inside a torch?
    

Then show or draw a basic torch image and **ask questions** like:

- “Have you used a torch during a blackout?”
    
- “What if I told you the same electricity that runs your fan can also run your toy robot?”
    

---

### 🔍 **Show Real Objects (If Available):**

Bring a torchlight, batteries, a small bulb or LED, and wires.

Let students observe:

- The **metal cap** and **flat side** of a battery
    
- The **switch**
    
- The **lamp** or LED
    

Then ask:

> “How do all these parts work together to make the lamp glow?”

---

### 📽️ **Optional Warm-up Demo (Simple Activity):**

**Activity**: Take a torch, slide its switch ON, and OFF.

- Ask students: “What’s happening here? Why does it glow only in one position?”
    

This leads to the **concept of a circuit** and **switches**.

---

## 💡 **Build Curiosity with Questions:**

Ask open-ended questions:

- “Why don’t wires made of rubber carry electricity?”
    
- “Why does the LED glow in one direction but not the other?”
    
- “What’s the role of the switch in a fan or torch?”
    
- “Can we make our own switch at home?”
    

Let students wonder — because curiosity fuels science.

---

## 🧪 **Transition to Core Topics:**

Now tell students:

> “In this chapter, we will build circuits, test materials, light bulbs and LEDs, learn symbols, and even make a switch with a safety pin!”

Write the **learning goals** on the board:  
✅ What is a circuit?  
✅ What are electric cells and batteries?  
✅ How do bulbs and LEDs glow?  
✅ What are conductors and insulators?  
✅ How to read and draw circuit diagrams?

---

## 🛠️ **Essential Teaching Tools:**

- Torch (real or chart/picture)
    
- Cells (AA batteries)
    
- Wires
    
- Mini bulbs or LEDs
    
- DIY switch materials (paper clips, cardboard, drawing pins)
    
- Chart of circuit symbols
    
- Worksheet or circuit diagram puzzle
